# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:

      # over here, we are mounting the current directory to the `/app` directory inside the container (which is the working directory of the container)
      # syntax is `<path to the directory on host>:<path to the directory inside the container>`
      # we're doing this because we want to reflect the changes made to the files in the current directory inside the container
      - .:/app
      # we also mount the node_modules directory inside the container at /app/node_modules. This is done to avoid installing the node_modules inside the container. 
      # node_modules will be installed on the host machine and mounted inside the container
      - /app/node_modules
